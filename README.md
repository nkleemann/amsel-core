# :crystal_ball: :bird: amsel-core

This is the core of **Amsel** (engl: common blackbird) a tool for generative composition producing monophonic phrases influenced by:
- feedback loops (f.e.: visual input)
- musical definitions

## Introduction

Every generative system needs a set of input vectors to produce it's output. Frequently those input vectors are:
- noise (random approach)
- huge datasets of MIDI or audio files (AI based approach)
- external sensor data (measurement approach)

The output of such systems can stand on it's own as works of art - but often times those processes feel like a "black box approach" creating
distance between the musicians intent and the algorithm. 

With **Amsel** I want to create a generative system working **with** me rather than **besides** me. I'm interesting in building a tool offering
new means of expression for artists- combining intent and reaction.

## WIP Notes

### Idea .compose files
```
A  major, duration: 4 bars
E  minor, duration: 2 bars
F  minor, duration: 2 bars
G# major, duration: 4 bars
```
Those files could be parsed and serve as instruction which Note Pools to fill/flush and when to switch. 
That way the User can provide harmony sequences to further strengthen control and intent.

### Other

-[] MIDI Sync

## Functionality

*>This is a Work In Progress<*

This is the core: IO, GUI and interaction will sit in a new repository, later merged with this one.

### WIP

- [x] Provide simple, functional & (mostly) well typed model of musical notes and their interaction in scales and phrases
- [x] Implement the MIDI protocol
- [x] Set up with WebMIDI to send notes via the IAC Driver
- [Â ] Simulate different playing styles (Impressions)
- [ ] Offer meaningfull input parameters to influence the generation of phrases
